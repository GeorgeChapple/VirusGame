I'm serious!

<n>
What? Oh don't be paranoid.
I've clicked on this link and
I'm fine!

Barry!! I can't believe you.
You've sent me this clearly
virus-filled website...
<pfb:1>
<n>
And now you don't believe me!
<pfb:0>
<n>
What happened anyway?
<pfb:1>
<n>
Well, after clicking on the
link YOU sent me, this weird
looking character turned up on
my screen!

Ok, well has anything changed?
Are any of your files missing?
Go look!
