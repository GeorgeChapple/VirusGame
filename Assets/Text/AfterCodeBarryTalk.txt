What!? Dude you were gone for ages.
Have you not seen my messages!?
<pfb:1>
<n>
I think this Daisy thing has blocked
my messages.
<pfb:0>
<n>
That's a pretty odd thing to say...
Have your files changed?
<pfb:1>
<n>
Yes! She's moving them around and adding new ones!
<pfb:0>
<n>
Hm, ok.. Maybe you do have a problem.
Why can't I see her!?
<pfb:1>
<n>
Reboot your computer, she might be there too.
<n>
She's totally a virus..
<pfb:2>
<n>
No I'm not.
<pfb:1>
<n>
AHA! Did you see that!?!
<pfb:0>
<n>
See what?
<pfb:1>
<n>
You can't see that!?
She just messaged both of us!
Let me send you a screenshot.

Well?
<pfb:1>
<n>
I think she's disabled some of my inputs..
<pfb:0>
<n>
Can you get rid of her?
<pfb:1>
<n>
I'll try to get a look at her files when I can.
Right now, she wants me to play these weird games..
<pfb:0>
<n>
You know, this is good for our story.
A new virus that tricks young users into... I don't know,
downloading ransomware?
<pfb:1>
<n>
Is this story worth MY data though!?
<pfb:0>
<n>
Oh come on! You can't get rid of her right now anyway.
Why don't you play along, and tell me what she's doing?
We'll make a guide on how to stop her, and sell the story!
<pfb:0>
<n>
If this virus ever becomes widespread, this story could
make us rich!!!
<pfb:1>
<n>
Well, it's not like I have a choice... Alright, I'll see
what she's up to and let you know.
<pfb:0>
<n>
I've got your back buddy! Well, in spirit.
