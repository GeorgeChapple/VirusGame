Barry? Can you hear me?

Yes! Hey man, what's going on?
<pfb:1>
<n>
I think I've tricked Daisy into generating
as many puzzles as possible. She should be
occupied for a while.
<pfb:1>
<n>
Oh okay! Well that's an interesting technique
for our readers!! What are you going to do now?
<pfb:1>
<n>
I'm going to look into the files of my own computer
and delete her.

<n>
What, you mean in the virtual machine you're currently using?
<pfb:1>
<n>
No, beyond that. Through her files downloaded
onto the device I am currently using.
<pfb:1>
<n>
She probably put something intersting on the
desktop, lazy designers normally do that..

Are you sure you want to delete her?
<pfb:1>
<n>
Yes!! We've got our story, and I'm not putting
my data at risk anymore.

Keep her alive.
<pfb:1>
<n>
What!? Dude she's a virus.
<pfb:0>
<n>
We've almost got this story!
Just keep her alive.
<pfb:1>
<n>
No man, I'm ending this.
She's being deleted.
