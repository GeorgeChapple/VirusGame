Wowie, Sellden! We sure learned a lot.
What will you do now?
<pfb:1?
I think... I'm going to turn my
computer off for a while.

You helped me, Daisy, you may as well
stay here for a bit. I don't think
you're any harm.
<n>
I'll figure you out later. For now...
<n>
Maybe I'll spend some time with my
daughter. Do some reading, I don't know.
<n>
I think it's time to spend some time away
from all this tech.
<n>
Go see the real world, y'know?
<pfb:2>

Weirdo. :3
