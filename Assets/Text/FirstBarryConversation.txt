Hey man!
How's everything going?
<pfb:1>
<n>
Oh hey, good thanks.
Just trying to find stuff to report on.
How are you?
<pfb:0>
<n>
Good thanks. You still trying to work on that police report?
<pfb:1>
<n>
You know I can’t talk much about it, but yeah.
<pfb:1>
<n>
My NDA doesn’t let me speak to anyone about what they’re working on
<pfb:1>
<n>
but if I can find just one small piece of evidence exposing them, I can tell the story through that.
<pfb:0>
<n>
…How long has it been since you were a detective?
<pfb:1>
<n>
About a year since I was made redundant.
<pfb:0>
<n>
How do you feel about that?
<pfb:1>
<n>
I guess it was meant to be... 
<pfb:1>
<n>
but I'm still fuming haha!
<pfb:0>
<n>
I see, best way to look at it I suppose. 
<pfb:0>
<n>
And yeah it was unfair they laid you off so quickly.
<pfb:1>
<n>
Not much I can do about it besides what I’m doing now. Just got to try and find something.
<pfb:0>
<n>
Well, I did stumble across something that might help you, would you like to see it?
<pfb:1>
<n>
Sure.
<pfb:0>
<n>
Alright, give me a sec.

Do you recognise this name?
<pfb:1>
<n>
I don't think I can say...
<pfb:0>
<n>
Ah, I see... 
Either way, just click on the link! Have a look.
<pfb:0>
<n>
You might find something you can write on.
<pfb:1>
<n>
I'm still using my virtual machine for this... Looks dodgy.
<pfb:0>
<n>
Alright you do you.
But I promise it's safe!

OPENS AND READS WEBPAGE.

Have you read the bit about the AI causing the detective to lose his job? 
<pfb:0>
<n>
Is that what happened to you?!
<pfb:1>
<n>
You know I can't talk about this Barry...
<pfb:1>
<n>
Are you trying to get me sued?? I don't have much money as it is.
<pfb:0>
<n>
Look, I know you can't tell me, but just hear me out...
<pfb:0>
<n>
In my mind, this could be something related to what you went through, if not exactly what happened to you.
<pfb:0>
<n> 
Regardless of whether or not you can tell me directly, what if we stole elements from this website, and combined them with some experiences you had? 
<pfb:0>
<n>
That way, you won’t be breaking any contract you signed, and we have a new and interesting story!
<pfb:1>
<n>
How do you know any of this is factual?!
<pfb:0>
<n>
Oh come on who cares about that!? 
<pfb:0>
<n>
It’s a story! We're reporters, which means we need stories to tell.
<pfb:0>
<n>
I know you're used to detective work where everything has to be factual, but....
<pfb:0>
<n>
This could be a hit for us regardless!
<pfb:0>
<n>
A rogue crime framing AI that is developed by the police!?
<pfb:0>
<n>
This could be groundbreaking for us! Think of the money!
<pfb:0>
<n>
Even if it is just a hoax, there’s at least a typical ‘the police are improving’ story here. 
<pfb:0>
<n>
It’s easy work!
<pfb:1>
<n>
I'm still unsure, but rent is due I guess. Alright, I'm with you. 
Let's make a story.
<pfb:0>
<n>
Knew you would buddy!!
